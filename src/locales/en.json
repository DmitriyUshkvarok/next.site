    "about_me": "Hi, my name is Dmitry and I am a web developer with experience in building interactive and responsive web applications. My portfolio includes eleven projects developed using technologies like React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, and many others. These projects not only demonstrate my technical skills, but also my ability to build high quality web applications.During my career, I have successfully worked on many projects that have helped me learn the principles of good architecture and design. One of my significant achievements is the creation of a commercial online store from the initial stages of development, including SEO optimization and deployment on a hosted site with its own domain. As part of my internship experience at Beetroot, I deepened my knowledge of WordPress and PHP, realizing the importance of attention to detail and project compliance. My experience at GoIT included working together on team projects, including two web applications. As a team leader, I assigned roles and tasks to members, ensuring that their skills were utilized effectively. We used GitHub for collaborative development, where I learned how to manage pull requests, conduct code reviews, and merge changes. This experience showed me the importance of collaboration and communication within a team.All this time in web development has helped me develop many skills including technical knowledge, project management and collaboration. I am willing to contribute my knowledge and experience to projects that require quality web solutions. Contact me and let's make your ideas a reality together."
